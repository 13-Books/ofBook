The section on random functions can be shortened to on example (with the other left as an exercise for the reader). 3 pages saved.

Excursion into using the distance function in the "For-Loop" section can be left as an exercise for the reader. 2 pages saved.

The section on creating your own replacement algorithm for the random function can be omitted (or again, left as an exercise). 4 pages saved.

Plus the savings that @bilderbuchi suggested from tightening up your print-outs and resizing images. This will depend on whether you try any of the above mentioned omissions. I could see you saving a lot of pages this way. 10 pages saved?

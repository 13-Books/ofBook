1. Introduction 

[This outline is based on workshops Golan taught with Kyle.]

========================================================
2. Preliminaries

2.1. Image data structures 
   -- 8u, 32f, etc.
   -- 1C, 3C, 4C images, etc.
   -- Back and forth between ofxCV, ofxOpenCV, unsigned char*, ofPixels.
   -- Example: color space conversions; converting RGB to Gray.

2.2. Image Arithmetic: mathematical operations on images
   -- adding two images together
   -- subtracting two images
   -- multiplying an image by a constant
   -- mentioning ROI 
   -- Example: creating an average of several images
   
2.3. Convolution Filtering
   -- Blurring an image
   -- Edge detection 
   -- Advanced sidebar: dealing with boundary conditions

2.4. Suggestions for Further Experimentation:
   -- Slit-Scanner
   -- Toy version of Text Rain. Fun with edge detection.
   -- Toy version of LASER Tag. Finding the brightest point, tracing a path.
   -- Toy version of Memo Akten's Gold: Optical flow + particle system

3. Scenario I. Basic Blobs (e.g. Manual Input Sessions) 

3.1. The Why 
   -- Some examples of projects that use blob-tracking
   -- and some scenarios that call for it. 
   
3.2. Detecting and Locating Presence and Motion 
   -- Detecting presence with Background subtraction
   -- Detecting motion with frame-differencing
   -- Binarization, blob detection and contour extraction
      -- Area settings on contour extraction
      -- Finding negative vs. positive contours
   
3.3. Image Processing Refinements
   -- Using a running average of background
   -- Erosion, dilation, median to remove noise after binarization
   -- Combining presence and motion in a weighted average
   -- Compensating for perspectival distortion and lens distortion
   
3.4. Thresholding Refinements
   -- Some techniques for automatic threshold detection 
   -- Dynamic thresholding (per-pixel thresholding)
   
3.5. The Vector space: Extracting information from Blob Contours
   -- Area, Perimeter, Centroids, Bounding box
   -- Calculcating blob orientation (central axis)
   -- Locating corners in contours
   -- 1D Filtering of contours to eliminate noise. 
   -- Convexity defects, contourFinder.getConvexityDefects()
   -- Other shape metrics; shape recognition 
   
3.6. Using Kinect depth images
   -- Finding the "fore-point" (foremost point)
   -- Background subtraction with depth images
   -- Remarks about gradients 
   
3.6. Suggestions for further experimentation: 
   -- Tracking multiple blobs with ofxCv.tracker
   -- Box2D polygons using OpenCV contours, e.g. https://vimeo.com/9951522
   
========================================================   
4. Scenario II. Face Tracking.

4.1. Overview
   -- Some examples of projects that use face-tracking
      -- Mary Huang's face typography
      -- Kyle & Arturo, face swapping
   
4.2. A basic face detector. 
   -- Face detection with classic OpenCV viola-Jones detector
   -- How it works, and considerations when using it. 
   
4.3. Advanced face analysis with the Saraghi FaceTracker

4.4. Suggestions for further experimentation: 
   -- Make a face-controlled puppet
   -- Toy version of David Tinapple's "The Face of TV": Find the average face of a TV channel
   
========================================================  
5. A Computer-Vision lexicon, and where to find out more information 

Computer vision is a huge field and we can't possibly cover all useful examples here. 
Sometimes people lack the terminology to know what to google for. 

-- Camera calibration. 
-- Homography transforms and re-projection.

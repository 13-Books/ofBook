## Introduction

An architectural web of threads spans a gallery space. It hangs abstract and undefined, a set of thin positive elements segmenting the dark negative space between. Dynamic imaginary forms are articulated into physical volume by the material of this thread, and the semi-material of the light. The visual gravity of the filaments occupying the space between.

A 2D canvas is reduced from a surface piece into a line segment, but then constructed into another dimension, a volume. Light creates contrast and order on the lines to articulate digital matter. Digital forms inhabit the interconnected boundaries of space, moulding visual mass,

The artists reference Picasso’s light painting, and Reticuláreas of Gego who’s work offers a contemplation of the material and immaterial, time and space, origin and encounter and art and technology.

## Digital Emulsion
Digital Emulsion (otherwise referred to as Re-projection Scanning) is a technique which combines 3D scanning with projection mapping in order to create new canvases for visual expression.

Line Segments Space employs Digital Emulsion in order to address light from the projectors onto the individual threads, whilst also determining the 3D geometry of the web.

### Structured light
Structured Light refers to a set of techniques which couple projectors with sensors to take readings of the physical world.

A very simple structured light technique is to project a thin white line onto a scene and to take a photo of it. Within the photo, we can see that when the line hits 3D features, it kinks and bends within the cameras image. Using some trigonometry we could perhaps calculate something about the 3D shape of the object.

And if we took many images (e.g. a video) as the line passed across the projector image, then we could perhaps recover a lot of information about the 

Generally for Digital Emulsion, we use a structured light technique called Graycode Structured Light. If you're interested in learning more, I suggest checking out either [ofxGraycode](http://github.com/elliotwoods/ofxGraycode) or [David laser scanner](http://www.david-3d.com/) (a free to download standalone scanning app which employs structured light).

One of the advantages of using Graycode structured light, is that it gives you accurate information of the location of the projector's pixels (rather than other techniques which give you information about the camera pixels).

## Technical overview
Line Segments Space employs Digital Emulsion, a technique whereby the projector both scans and augments a scene.

The light on the thread is enacted by digital video projectors. Each video projector pixel passes through the space as a ray from the projector to the opposite wall, each pixel is carried along a unique path. Each pixel may or may not hit a thread, or many hit many threads. We presume that each line segment of thread is completely covered by pixels.

Kimchi and Chips create technology which paints into different dimensions, bringing new canvases and expanding the possibilities for artists to articulate form. These technologies become a corpus of code, offered without restriction on the internet. Their code  is adopted by other artists and corporations, spreading values and ideas implicit with the artists’ work into shared cultural idea space. Line Segments Space lives both as a dynamic gallery object, and as an encapsulation of the techniques as new computer code and tools on the internet.

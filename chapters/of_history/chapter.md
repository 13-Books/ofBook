#History

*by [Zach Lieberman](http://thesystemis.com)*


Openframeworks began around 2004 / 2005.  I was teaching at Parsons School of Design, and at the same time, making a living as an artist creating interactive projects with code.  

I had graduated a few years earlier from grad school in 2002 and we were using computational tools like Director / Lingo and Flash when I was there -- it was the heyday of flash experimentation.  In 2002 my professor, Golan Levin, invited me to collaborate with him on some projects after I graduated from school and he introduced me to ACU, a C++ library that had been developed at MIT under the Aesthetics and Computation Group, the group that John Maeda ran which had students like Elise Co, Peter Cho, Ben Fry, Casey Reas and Golan.   

Acu as a library was great, but quite oriented to late 90s tech such as SGI machines.  It was also not open source and not actively maintained.  Folks like Ben Fry had fortuitusly moved on to developing processing and it seemed like it wasn't going to last us a long time for our work.  It seemed like we would need an alternative codebase moving forward. 

In addition, I really wanted to share the code I was writing in my professional practice with my students.  I remember vividly having conversations with the administration of the department at Parsons wehre they said, "art students don't want to learn C++".  I started teaching classes with OF in 2005, and I had students like Theo Watson, Christine Sugrue, Evan Roth who created remarkably wild experimental work with OF and that argument crumbled rapidly.   C++ provided low level access to the machine for things like computer vision, sound processing, access to hardware as well as access to a wide array of librarys that other folks had written.  It opened up doors to expressive uses of computation.

Theo Watson, who was my student in 2005, joined the OF team to help produce an OSX version.  I'm not totally sure when our first official release was, but I remember visidly presenting openframeworks to the public in a sort of beta state at the 2006 OFFF festival where we had an advanced processing workshop held at Hangar. One of the participants of that workshop, Arturo Castro, joined the OF team to help produce a linux version.  

In 2008 we won a prize at Ars electronica and built a labratory called OF lab which brought many of us who had been working remotely face to face.  It was the first of many such world-wide meetings, labs, workshops, developers conferences that have helped grow the community.  That year we also held an OF workshop in Japan at YCAM and discovered there was a whole community of people across the world using this tool.  It was way more global then we had thought.  It was simultaneously heartening and also a little bit frightening, the realization that there were people around the world who were using this tool to make a living. 

In recent years, we've tried to help grow the community -- folks like Kyle Mcdonald have helped organize the diverse interests of developers and keep everything focused while Caitlin Morris has produced detailed surveys of the community.  In addition, there are section leaders, helping grow different parts of the codebase and help imagine what modern OF looks like.   Finally, there are countless contributors to OF who help with the codebase, documentation, examples, addons and help answer questions on the forum.

We've tried as hard as we can to create a friendly atmosphere around programming, which can be an unfriendly activity.  Somehow, luckily, we've attracted some of the most amazing, helpful, warm hearted, lovely people to come be a part of this and if you're not already, we'd like to say **welcome**.

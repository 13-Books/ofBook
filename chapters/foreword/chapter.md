#Foreword

*by [Zach Lieberman](http://thesystemis.com)*


Openframeworks began around 2004 / 2005.  I was teaching at Parsons School of Design, and at the same time, making a living as an artist creating interactive projects with code.  

I had graduated a few years earlier from grad school in 2002 and we were using computational tools like Director / Lingo and Flash when I was there -- it was the heyday of flash experimentation.  In 2002 my professor, Golan Levin, invited me to collaborate with him on some projects after I graduated from school and he introduced me to ACU, a C++ library that had been developed at MIT under the Aesthetics and Computation Group, the group that John Maeda ran which had students like Elise Co, Peter Cho, Ben Fry, Casey Reas and Golan.   

Acu as a library was great, but quite oriented to late 90s tech such as SGI machines.  It was also not open source and not actively maintained.  Folks like Ben Fry had fortuitusly moved on to developing processing and it seemed like it wasn't going to last us a long time for our work.  It seemed like we would need an alternative codebase moving forward. 

In addition, I really wanted to share the code I was writing in my professional practice with my students.  I remember vividly having conversations with the administration of the department at Parsons wehre they said, "art students don't want to learn C++".  I started teaching classes with OF in 2005, and I had students like Theo Watson, Christine Sugrue, Evan Roth who created remarkably wild experimental work with OF and that argument crumbled rapidly.   C++ provided low level access to the machine for things like computer vision, sound processing, access to hardware as well as access to a wide array of librarys that other folks had written.  It opened up doors to expressive uses of computation.

Theo Watson, who was my student in 2005, joined the OF team to help produce an OSX version.  I'm not totally sure when our first official release was, but I remember vividly presenting openframeworks to the public in a sort of beta state at the 2006 OFFF festival where we had an advanced processing workshop held at Hangar. One of the participants of that workshop, Arturo Castro, joined the OF team to help produce a linux version.  Theo, Artuo and I have been joined by a huge group of people who use OF and help contribute to it. 

In 2008 we won a prize at Ars electronica and built a labratory called OF lab which brought many of us who had been working remotely face to face, often for the first time.  It was the first of many such world-wide meetings, labs, workshops, developers conferences that have helped grow the community.    That year we also held an OF workshop in Japan at YCAM and discovered there was a whole community of people across the world using this tool.  It was way more global then we had thought.  It was simultaneously heartening and also a little bit frightening, the realization that there were people around the world who were using this tool to make a living. 

We've been lucky in these events to be able to work with great institutions such as The Studio for Creative Inquiry, V&A museum, YCAM, Imal, Ars Electronica and Eyebeam, which have helped sponsored events to bring the OF community together. 

In recent years, we've tried to help grow and expand the community -- folks like Kyle Mcdonald have helped organize the diverse interests of developers and keep everything focused while Caitlin Morris has produced detailed surveys of the community.  Greg Borenstein and James George helped launch ofxAddons.com, an online repository which helps organize the impressive quantity of addons that the community is creating on a daily basis.  In addition, there are now section leaders for the development of OF, helping grow different parts of the codebase and help imagine what modern OF looks like.   Finally, there are countless contributors to OF who help with the codebase, documentation, examples, addons and help answer questions on the forum.   

More then anything, we've tried as hard as we can to create a friendly atmosphere around programming, which can be an unfriendly activity and in some ways isolating.  We preach the idea of art making as a labratory, as R&D for humanity and OF is one attempt to make a large lab where we can grow and share experiments together. Somehow, luckily, and improbably, we've attracted some of the most amazing, helpful, warm hearted, lovely people to come be a part of this and if you're not already, we'd like to say **welcome**.


## about this book

This book, much in the spirit of openframeworks, is a community driven afair and it's **very much a work in progress**.   It was a suggestion, on the openframeworks developers mailing list which kicked this of and for a the past months we've been hacking away on this. 

A couple of notes, 

* Feedback is very much appreciated and we'd like to know what's missing, or what you'd like to be in here.  Likewise, if you find something helpful, we'd love to here it too!  Our github repo is active and we take issues and pull requests.  
* Please note that there's likely gaps here.  We've tried to roughly lay out chapters in order of skill level, but since it's a collectively written book it can feel a bit disorienting, some chapters are on the long side, some are short.  Think of it not as a book you read front to back, but more like a collection of short tutorials from the community.

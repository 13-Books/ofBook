[Still working on what exactly the corresponding code will be for these sections.  Will insert before Monday.]

Documenting/Sharing Your Work 
  - Stationary Images
    - ofSaveScreen()
    - ofBeginSaveScreenAsPDF()
  - Animation/Video
    - ofxGifEncoder
    - ofxVideoRecorder
    - Since these haven't worked well for me on windows, possibly a quick aside on alternative/custom solutions:
      - For interactive works, 3rd party recording software
      - For noninteractive works, creating a 'rendering' mode, saving frames and stiching them together using ffmpeg (or photoshop/gimp)

Meshes
  - This may end up pushing the limits on what can fit in a chapter, but I'd love to see some coverage of 3D basics and meshes in the book
  - I could attempt to shorten up the generative mesh tutorial (http://openframeworks.cc/tutorials/graphics/generativemesh.html) and include it
  - That would add:
    - Background on meshes
    - A way to think about creating a generative mesh
    - ofEasyCam

Links to Addons
  - Adding Physics
    - ofxBullet
    - ofxBox2d
  - Computer Vision
    - ofxCv or ofxOpenCv
  - Vector Graphics
    - ofxSVG or ofxVectorGraphics

Where to learn more
  - I'll sort this out in more detail once I have an idea of what the other chapters in the book will look like
  - Book will already have computer vision and shaders, so I'd like to point to resources on particle systems, opengl, vector math, and whatever else fits.

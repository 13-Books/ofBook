Simple Graphics Loop
  - Simple section to get comfortable the update/draw loops and timing
  - Clearing the screen with a background
  - Drawing a circle on top of the background at the mouse position
  - Transparency and simple trail effect (using setBackgroundAuto() and clearing the screen with a transparent rect)
  - Controlling framerate
  
2D Graphics
  - A section about the possibilities of mixing code and visuals
  - Cover topics in this order:
    - ofLine, ofRect, ofCircle, ofEllipse
    - Fill and stroke concepts
    - Specifying color (grayscale, RGB, RGBA, HSB)
    - Curve, beziers, and custom shape
  - Teach in the context of a project with generative visuals, like:
    - A cellular automata like Conway's Game of Life
    - Custom generative brushes
    - Using a movie or image to drive the creation of a ton of simple shapes
    - [I will sort out which type of project before Monday]
  
Coordinate Systems Transformations
  - Cover these topics:
    - ofPushMatrix, ofPopMatrix
    - ofRotate, ofScale, ofTranslate
  - Teach using scale, rotate and translate to generate animated, spiralling rectangles like in CoordSystem.png

Documenting/Sharing Your Work 
  - Stationary Images
    - ofSaveScreen()
    - ofBeginSaveScreenAsPDF()
  - Animation/Video
    - ofxGifEncoder
    - ofxVideoRecorder
    - Since these haven't worked well for me on windows, possibly a quick aside on alternative/custom solutions:
      - For interactive works, 3rd party recording software
      - For noninteractive works, creating a 'rendering' mode, saving frames and stiching them together using ffmpeg (or photoshop/gimp)

Meshes
  - This may end up pushing the limits on what can fit in a chapter, but I'd love to see some coverage of 3D basics and meshes in the book
  - I could attempt to shorten up the generative mesh tutorial (http://openframeworks.cc/tutorials/graphics/generativemesh.html) and include it
  - That would add:
    - Basics of meshes
      - Modes, indicies, vertices
    - One way to think about creating a generative mesh
      - Loading image, getting pixels, using them as source data
      - Applying rules to the data to generate vertices and connections
    - ofEasyCam to navigate
    - How to handle the mesh to create simple animation and interactivity

  - Adding Physics

    - ofxBox2d
  - Computer Vision
    - ofxCv or ofxOpenCv
  - Vector Graphics
    - ofxSVG or ofxVectorGraphics

Where to learn more
  - I'll sort this out in more detail once I have an idea of what the other chapters in the book will look like
  - Book will already have computer vision and shaders, so I'd like to point to resources on particle systems, opengl, vector math, and whatever else fits.

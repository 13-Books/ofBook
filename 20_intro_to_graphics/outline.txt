Documenting Your Work 
  - Stationary Images
    - ofSaveScreen()
    - ofBeginSaveScreenAsPDF()
  - Animation/Video
    - ofxGifEncoder
    - ofxVideoRecorder
    - Since these haven't worked well for me on windows, possibly a quick aside on alternative/custom solutions:
      - For interactive works: 3rd party recording software
      - For noninteractive works: Creating a 'rendering' mode, saving frames and stiching them together using ffmpeg


Linking to Addons
  - Adding Physics

    - ofxBox2d
  - Computer Vision
    - ofxCv or ofxOpenCv
  - Vector Graphics
    - ofxSVG or ofxVectorGraphics

Where to learn more
  - I'll sort this out in more detail once I have an idea of what the other chapters in the book will look like
  - Book will already have computer vision and shaders, so I'd like to point to resources on particle systems, opengl, vector math, and whatever else fits.
